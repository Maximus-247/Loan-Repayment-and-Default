Again, in finance, a default is a failure to meet the legal obligations of a loan, for example when a home buyer fails to make a mortgage payment or when a coorporation or government fails to pay a bond which has reached maturity.
Machine learning models are employed to predict a possible loan  repayment and loan default. Logistic regression is one of the models that can be used for this prediction and classification problems. In this writeup, logistic regression is employed to predict the a possible loan repayment and loan default. 
The accuracy of the model can be used to determine how reliable a model is in predicting possible loan repayment and loan default.
